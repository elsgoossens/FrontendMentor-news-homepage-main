## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to work with a mix of flexbox and grid and when to use which one.

### Continued development

This solution is still on progress, the grid of title-intro is not ok yet on desktop format, still need to add the mini interactions and the opening/closing menu on mobile.

### Useful resources

- [Build Layouts with CSS Grid - The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPuYbmmPdEM) Learned about grid with this awsome course.
